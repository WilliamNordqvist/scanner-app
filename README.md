# Scanner - App 

A project that I created to combine two projects I have worked with lately.
Scan functionality and app script. 

The front-end is a simple scanner applikation that uses "react-qr-barcode-scanner" to scan the barcodes. 

The list of responses is then being sent to a google sheet, that has ben built as a rest api with app script.  See [this repo](https://github.com/WilliamNordqvist/google-sheet-rest-api) for more info. 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
